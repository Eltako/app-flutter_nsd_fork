# Flutter NSD plugin example

Demonstrates how to use the flutter_nsd plugin.

## Getting Started

in `main.dart`, change the service type from `_example._tcp.` to the real service you're trying
to discover. Then simply launch the app on either iOS or Android. Note that for iOS, the example
is currently configured to only work with a simulator. Please see the library README.md for more
info on that.
